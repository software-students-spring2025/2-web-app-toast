## Steps necessary to run the software

1. Clone the repository to local machine
2. Run the app.py file under the Jitter folder. (Make sure python is in path)
    1. Run the following command in a terminal in the project directory
        * Depending on the machine
            * Run python3 app.py
            * Run python app.py
    2. Alternatively, in VScode, use the Run Python File button when the app.py file is opened.
3. Follow the resulting web address in terminal to see the app on computer.
4. Use http://"serverip":5000 to view the app on your phone on the same network.
    * Replace "serverip" with the ip of your server, most likely the local ipv4 of the computer that you ran app.py from.
